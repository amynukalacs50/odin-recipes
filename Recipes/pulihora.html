    <p> <h3><strong> <em> DESCRIPTION: </em></strong></h3>
       Chintapandu Pulihora and Nimmakaya (Lemon) rice are the most common among the rice varieties.<br>
       Though the process for lemon rice is similarly followed by all, pulihora recipe changes from home to home.<br>
       My mom used to make a special Pulihora Gujju (Tamarind Paste) and when she wants to make pulihora all she needs to do is to mix the rice with the Pulihora Gujju. <br>
       And Voila you have a delicious bowl of lip smacking tangy Chintapandu Pulihora to devour.
